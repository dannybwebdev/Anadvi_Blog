*Give example*

Imagine that you’ve been in a relationship with your significant other for nearly a year. She’s an amazing person that has never left your mind since the day you met her. But the spark doesn’t seem to be there anymore. She’s growing distant. Communicating with her is a lot more difficult than it used to be. You noticed that she’s talking more about this guy from work. A guy that she swears is only a friend. But she smiles every time she gets a text from him. It almost feels like she’s more willing to text him than she is to have a conversation with you.

Eventually she mentions that she’s going to hang out with him. She insists that it’s just two friends getting coffee together. But to you, it looks very similar to a date. What makes it worse is that she initiated these plans, it was her idea not his. And right before she leaves to go see him, she informs you that she hasn’t told him about you.

You have now just become a Back Pocket Boyfriend.

*Define Back pocket boyfriend*

So what is a back pocket relationship?

You become a back pocket boyfriend when your significant other is actively, but often discreetly, looking for another potential boyfriend while still in a relationship with you.

Usually, you’ll start to notice changes in your relationship. One thing you might see is your girlfriend going through the motions of a stereotypical relationship without any of the feelings or infatuation that  she used to have at the beginning. Another potential situation you might see is a “Relationship in Name  Only”. This is where your relationship has evolved to the point where you’re no longer doing anything that you would normally see in a close relationship, like not spending any free time with each other, or no longer getting each other gifts.

For many possible reasons, your girlfriend doesn’t want to be single, so she makes sure that she’s nearly secure in another relationship before she ends the relationship with you. While still being able to “pull you out of her back pocket” encase she doesn’t find anyone else. In extreme cases this leads to physical cheating, but most of the time it ends with what’s now known as “Emotional Cheating” before she decides to move on.

*Explain why the put you in that position*

So why does this happen?

Well, it simply boils down to your significant other being insecure with the idea of being single.
