            <h1>Do You Think You&#39;re Being Cheated On? It Might Not Matter...</h1>
            <!--StartFragment-->
<p>We often get asked for advice on how to deal with the emotional aftermath from being the victim of a cheating partner. Surprisingly enough it’s one of the most asked for pieces of advice. It’s up there with “How do I find a girlfriend” and “Should I break up with him”. We understand why. Emotions around relationships can be very confusing and hard to deal with. Seeking help through asking for advice is only natural. However, we often see situations where the asker isn’t actually sure if they’ve been cheated on. They describe a situation and then asks if the situation they just described is cheating, or if their emotions are valid. Well, what we can say is that, yes, their emotions are valid… but not for the reason that they think.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Anytime someone asks about a particular situation they’ve just gone through and are curious if they’ve just been cheated on, we along with many others are quick to play yes man. We immediately jump to calling the situation a red flag and express that the asker has definitely just been cheated on. We always come to this conclusion with absolutely no context other than the gut feeling of the person asking for advice.</p>
<p></p>
<p>One day though, we had someone ask if he had been cheated on and explain his situation, but instead of jumping to being a yes man, we actually took the time to dissect he’s situation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is what he explained:</p>
<p></p>
<p>“To preface, my wife and I have been married for four years now. This past weekend I was away in the next state over from me visiting my parents. She told me that she was going to take the opportunity to have the girls over for a lady’s night, while she had the house to herself. I thought this was a great idea since she hasn’t seen her friends in a while. But something happened and I don’t know what to make of it. I have a Video doorbell, it notifies me every time it detects movement of person size. When it does this it saves a recording of the movement to the cloud, and I’m able to watch it later. I had a notification for each of her three friends that came off and a fourth notification for the pizza delivery guy. The problem though, is that I ended up getting two more notifications while I was sleeping. One at 2:00AM and one at 6:00AM. I was confused, so I watched the video doorbell recordings associated with those notifications. I saw has made me very worried. The 2:00AM notification showed my wife put tape over the camera on the doorbell. And the 6:00AM notification showed her taking off the tape. When I got back home, I confronted her about those notifications. What she explained to me had me a little confused. She explained that the boyfriend, Luke, of one of her friends, Julie, came to pick her up. She said that she thought I would be made that he came over. I asked how long he was over, and she said just for like 15 minutes while Julie was looking for her things that she was going to take home. I then asked, then why did it take so long for her to remove the tape. She just said that she forgot until the next morning. The thing that is bothering me is that I know Luke, he’s a good friend. I don’t have a problem with him coming over, especially if he was just picking up Julie. I just don’t understand why she felt like she had to do this, if she’s telling the truth. I want to trust her but this seems really weird. Should I trust her? I don’t know what to do next.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>As you can probably imagine our first gut instinct is that, yes she is definitely cheating on you. All of this is just a huge read flag. No one would hide the fact that someone was just getting picked up. She had something else to hide, which is why the tape was on the camera for so long.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But after we thought about it, what if the wife wasn’t lying?</p>
